## Introduction
This is a code repository for the Blockchain app developed in React. 

We will create a cryptocurrency app. We're going to use React and multiple APIs powered by https://rapidapi.com.

Clone the repo or download the code zip file

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```
or open your project folder then select the path file .eg "D:\react\blockchain _react". then type cmd. 
Automatically the cmd terminal opens up.

Inside the newly created terminal you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm install`

and

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
